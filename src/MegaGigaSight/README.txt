This is the client you can use for the integrated experiments.
It uploads the chunked video segments. They should be placed on the mobile device first, the videos
are not included in the app package itself.

You should place the files in the correct directory on the mobile device! 
The correct directory structure is as follows:
(Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_MOVIES)/480p_5s
".."/480p_30s
".."/480p_300s
".."/1080p_5s
".."/1080p_30s
".."/1080p_300s

The uploads of the videos can be easily done with File Explorer and connecting the mobile device with a USB cable.
