This is a developing project and some features might not be stable yet.
Please visit our website at <http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/>.

This code has been successfully run on a Google Nexus with Android Jelly Bean. Other devices might give problems, please report them.

To deploy the application on your own device, the best way is to import the source code into Eclipse, compile and push through ADB. 

You have to set a custom debug key in Eclipse to get the Google Maps to work.
You have two options:
a) you generate your own debug key and put the correct key in the AndroidManifest
b) you use my debug key and set Eclipse to use a custom debug key via  Window->Preferences->Android->Build->Custom debugstore. Contact me to have the appropriate debug key.


**Note on Privacy Settings
Each time you press "Time", "Location" or "Content", you add a new rule with a single condition. This is the reason why, for example, you will not see your previously defined circles appearing on the Google Map in the ContentRuleActivity.
